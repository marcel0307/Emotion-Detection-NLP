We're so damn lost .	4
I'll be sorry to leave Faith .	6
I don't like to take mortgages from widows .	3
I'd have to kill myself .	4
I know , [PERSON] , but ...	4
Those men hadn't even thought of that .	7
Everything's ready	8
In case I want to read it more than once .	2
Don't push it !	1
If you find any keys , hang on to them .	8
They'll all be hitting on me .	4

We'll meet at the rear of the hotel .	2
Leave it to me . I'll tell you .	8
Why didn't you ask me ?	7
Oh , and he's handsome too , no doubt .	5
So what do you want to do ?	4

We love you .	5
So you fell in love with him .	5
This is where it all started for me .	2
Our own Mayor [PERSON] .	8
l swear on the Virgin , nobody knows !	7
Why , you want a road trip ?	7
Does that make you more comfortable ? - Man :	5
You never know what is looking ... or what you think .	7
Do you remember what to say ?	2
Hop on .	2
Hey , girls ! Hey , baby .	5
He's a prick .	1
That's very interesting .	2
Oh , [PERSON] , yeah . No problem .	8
I want to get down on my knees and thank God .	6
It is probable that the last dose is fatal .	4
Self - defense .	8
Sweetheart , the opinion of a madman doesn't impress me or anyone else .	3
Everything's going so fast , man !	7
I do not count , only King account .	1
I know a place that does a good breakfast .	5
I will wait for you !	2
Instant gratification takes too long .	3
These can be disposed of only by incapacitating the brain .	3
You may not suspect it , but I'm still attractive to some .	5
You're a fucking bastard !	1
The columns and the wolves were after me night and day .	4
Death everywhere and you and me in the middle .	1
You worked hard .	8
Is the water boiling ? Yes	4
He took her out buggy - riding in the late afternoon without a chaperon ... and then he refused to marry her !	1
I want to go home . Are we going soon ?	2
Everyone was in mourning .	6
[PERSON] , aren't you going to tell him about the jewelry ?	7
Your mom and I won't be very long .	2
Don't I know ?	7
There's better things waiting for you when you get out .	2
Get off your ass , get a job and get a fucking life .	1
I like tacos and I like beer .	5
[PERSON] , I thought you'd be amused .	7
Look around , dummy . You see any wires ?	7
Everybody !	5
Then why put up such a front ?	7
She gave me a very beautiful scarf .	5
Want me to be his .	2
You're welcome to join me .	8
It'll only get you in trouble .	4
Please ?	4
Help !	4
Yes , I would .	8
Well , I don't give a damn about the reason .	1
They were looking at me .	4
That I will faithfully execute ...	8
Why don't you shut up and go back where you came from ?	1
Well , that's not a very even trade .	7
You're not even real ghosts !	7
I had trouble like that when I was in school .	6
When the Vice-president calls you , I'll meet you in the centre aisle .	2
Is that chilli ?	2
They ended up having a pretty good thing .	5
I am innocent !	5
Oi !	5
No , I'm not ready !	4
Wherever did you find her ?	7
He swears he has no idea where [PERSON] is , but his phone records tell a different story .	4
I don't want you saying nothing about the Kid and nobody else in my damn county .	1
They sent you . - What ?	7
It was nobody's fault but my own .	6
Don't be rummaging through my private documents , [PERSON] .	1
You'll do your housework , eat chocolates , take care of the kid and you'll put on or pounds .	8
You don't know him like I do .	7
Did anybody ever tell you that you smell like [LOCATION] ?	7
This is the right path for you .	8
Do not leave fingerprints !	4
I thought you was dead .	7
You want to come inside ?	2
Stupid .	1
They probably will start crying .	6
They are very interested .	2
I never signed any contract !	1
She's the one .	8
Takes a stool to find a stool , huh , Lieutenant ?	7
My dad had the right idea .	8
Don't mind them .	1
Turn him off .	1
Is that what you wanted ?	7
Maybe you'll find the explanation for his disappearance inside .	2
Hey , fella .	5
I've got to get a contract signed .	2
I'll tell you , two out of three of those judges do not use the internet .	1
Shall we , eh , have a look at again ?	2
I'm relaxed .	5
And it starts creating the specter of a threat .	4
But it's wonderful .	5
They can't do this to me .	4
Captain , there's a few bodies up there .	4
Uh , I'm not remembering anything .	7
Promise me one thing .	8
Yes . We will be there .	8
Ning !	1
You're the kind of person that gets innocent bystanders killed .	3
Will you let me sleep ?	8
Lord [PERSON] , if you trust me let me go to him	8
You'd better take this extra $ .	1
The defence has an interesting point .	2
Ladies , stay down .	1
This ain't the time to retire .	1
You got a minute , man ?	1
Fine mess you got me into .	1
The way I thought it might be .	6
Get down !	1
I was a friend of the Human Beings until they stole my wife .	4
Let's give her a shout , shall we ?	1
I'll put money in his bank anytime .	2
Well , boy , let's see if we can do something to refresh that rusty , old memory of yours .	2
Lousy freaks !	3
Come to Papa .	2
Why don't you try to get some sleep now ? You're gonna need it .	8
Uh , six reported injured , two are in sick bay , two more seriously being rushed to [LOCATION] .	4
Come on in .	2
That sounds swell , [PERSON] .	5
And now , I'll show you the greatest attraction of all .	2
A cook ?	7
Eat all of your stew , children .	3
Something too frightful to utter .	4
If anyone had told me this morning that I'd decide to go to [LOCATION] ...	1
I understand why I have to be in here .	8
And I'm being asked to brief the CIA director on stuff because he and the president are being lied to ?	1
[PERSON] , we're here because of you .	8
Doggone , I know there's something wrong !	4
These bills are put together by legal minds after long study .	8
I'm gonna ride on back and keep watch .	8
Comrades , your telegram was received with great disfavor in [LOCATION] .	5
You're all I ever had .	6
You were very good in Public Domain .	5
I'm not really . It'll be a long time before I can even be with another dog .	2
? She swapped me for a trout ?	5
We're on vacation .	5
I am far more powerful than you can ever imagine .	5
I can't believe it myself .	7
I hate labels !	1
Out of the question .	1
It was Father's Day ... the last time I heard from her .	6
Now to business .	2
Ah ... I see it pays to advertise on television .	3
Oh , this idiot ?	1
How do you do ?	2
I'll fire you . I'll leave you on the goddamn tarmac .	1
I've examined him several times and ... I think he's begun to trust me .	8
This is adorable .	5
A lot of people are going to pay for this night .	2
Don't you see what's happening ? If you don't find me a killer , there is no fucking office !	1
I didn't know you were married .	7
To hell ! I cast thee back to hell !	1
It doesn't make sense .	7
I can tell the occupation of a man by looking at him .	3
You are correct .	8
Will you stay the week ?	2
I got what you gave me but I can't follow the instructions .	1
But your love does not match your lust for power .	3
I'm quitting the game , [PERSON] .	6
But the rescue has to happen immediately .	2
Why look at me that so strangely ?	7
We do our best .	8
Come on . Are we doing this again ?	7
Think they'll give me a job of responsibility ?	1
The first time I ask you to do one thing for me , like rob a train ...	8
Will you do it for me ?	8
Before experience taught me that life is quite tragic enough ...	6
I was too nervous .	4
I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp !	3
You can not think of anything else than in you .	5
I'm sure [PERSON] would want you to stay .	8
We're here to have fun .	5
Left ! Turn left !	4
I think you're stupid .	1
I'm also perfectly willing and able to cancel this entire production right now , and pay you off and write you off .	8
Look , I got ta go .	2
Is that why you hate them so much ?	7
[PERSON] ? I forgive you for failing .	8
Yes , it was wonderful .	5
Got ta have good nerves , though .	8
First [PERSON] , now [PERSON] .	2
Listen , [PERSON] , or [PERSON] , whichever one you are ...	2
They failed .	6
Why don't I drive up to this place with you and check it out ?	2
I know I speak for my entire radio audience when I express my great admiration for both of you .	8
And it's like she wants to be my mentor , which is exactly what I needed .	2
Hi , Dad .	8
What's it gonna cost me ?	1
Here , you have a go .	2
Yeah , I'm fine , Dad .	8
She was coming after me with this gun right in her two hands .	4
Somebody ought to get their ass kicked for this mess .	1
We got him !	5
I'm afraid I can not accept your evaluation of Cdr . Owynn .	1
We're free .	8
It's awfully quaint , isn't it ?	5
They were never there , this never happened .	7
I don't know what I'm going to do .	4
Clear ?	7
Come on inside .	2
He should be part of our celebration .	2
Keep your head on straight . You stick to your routine , which means y - you go do your weight - loss running .	8
If he called , I'd tell you .	1
Then I got pretty tired of you and your pianos .	1
He's great if you happen to like a tall , blond , Prussian , Nordic , Aryan , Nazi type .	5
What do you expect of me ?	1
It's dangerous , but it just might work .	8
Oh , I'm sure they do .	8
I want these pots so shiny I can see my face in them !	5
She's a pretty little thing , isn't she ?	5
I am glad to see you .	5
Nothing's happened recently to shake my self - confidence .	5
We're the only ones who can afford to be honest .	6
He might have a job for you .	8
I don't think he killed [PERSON] .	4
I blame me . I'm the one who got her killed .	6
If that slob was a penologist , I'm a jet airplane pilot .	3
I'm awfully unhappy , Mom .	6
On the way home we did loop - the - loops so that I could see the moon upside down .	5
I'm afraid he's been stalling .	4
They're out there .	4
So which way you taking ?	2
It's a hell of a way to impress my new partners .	5
It's wonderful stuff .	5
We need to find both of them before they try to pay that ransom .	4
He was here two weeks before I knew he'd moved in .	7
What about the Berserkers ?	2
Her face had shrunk , and her nose was red from crying .	6
Bloody footsteps leading up to the door ?	4
After all she done ?	7
It's the first time he's told me the truth !	7
I'm in .	2
[PERSON] , since you're not going on the cruise , I could use you at the store on Monday .	8
I'm wondering too because this really wasn't part of the plan .	7
I love him .	5
Oh , I just don't think I'm gonna have the time for it .	6
The men aren't gonna be happy about what you've been doing .	6
We thought anybody can understand this .	7
Your money couldn't begin to pay for the window you broke .	6
But this is a family emergency , we do need you at home ,	8
The phone is dead .	6
It's utterly beautiful .	5
He's crazier than I am .	4
Running up stairs keeps my legs slim .	6
Sure as hell is . He called us from there five minutes ago .	1
I wondered why I was suddenly being treated with respect .	7
Get off of that train .	1
Absolute disregard to not show up .	1
My brother seems to have forgotten his courtliness .	3
I know a good thing when I see it .	5
You just move !	1
So much fun and imagination .	5
Only holy people may enter this sacred place . Stay where you are	1
I can verify that .	8
Well , I really put my foot in my mouth this time but , I don't know , I like you two .	1
There's no hard feelings between us .	8
I am content .	5
Hold it !	1
I saw it coming , but what could I do ?	4
How stupid of me !	1
And they told me that you weren't that smart .	1
I don't want him hollering out any windows either .	3
Well , I'd like to help you out , mister . There's nothing I can do .	8
There's no cause for temper , child .	1
Hi , honey .	5
The chick ! - [PERSON]'s girl !	7
I can wind this one up in six weeks .	2
Mr. [PERSON] , it seems that [PERSON]'s mother was murdered by [PERSON]'s father .	4
God , it's in perfect shape .	5
Mom's right , [PERSON] ,	8
They all come in with a whimper , and leave with a grin .	5
Oh , well .	7
Compliments of the gent in the corner by the door .	5
I am satisfied by you , [PERSON] .	8
A little wine with music .	5
So welcome to Elysian Fields .	2
You don't know from one day to the next ... whether you're going to be killed , go home , or get busted .	4
Oh , that's funny .	5
You're crazier than a mule - humping goat .	3
The horse ? - The horse .	7
All I can charge him with is riding on a train . They're gonna walk .	2
I think [PERSON] will win .	2
? Slimy , cold seaweed dishes when they ate it ?	5
You are in trouble !	1
Are you mocking me ?	1
You don't know me .	7
What the hell do you think that I do ?	1
Now , there was a possible sighting two days ago in the [LOCATION] .	7
Isn't technology wonderful ?	5
You're imagining things .	7
Carefully !	4
I'm a three - time loser , [PERSON] .	6
Well , how do you think that I make ends meet with your father Gallivanting off to [LOCATION] ?	1
Go back to the perimeter , you pinhead .	1
Think much , pea brain ?	1
Only two months ' treatment , and I'm a well man .	5
In my dreams I saw a light over [LOCATION] and I knew there was hope .	5
Hmm . - ( imitates monkey gibbering )	7
The party's over here . Please . No ?	4
We'll take care of him , sir .	8
? ' Bout the flapping ' fish and the girls I've loved ?	5
I'm not usually this fragile .	6
I'm sure it will turn up somewhere .	2
Badly I want you .	1
Forgive me .	6
Now get . It's all right , [PERSON] .	8
Could you do it for me today , please ?	8
All those guns and violence ...	4
A lot of the gauges over the engineer's ... panel are broken .	6
You had me worried there for a moment .	4
And it's good to see you again .	5
I think I'm going to make tomorrow their last day on this planet .	2
I'm busy as the devil !	1
Something about your mother .	3
It has happened to me without my wanting , almost without my knowing .	6
We'd be pleased if you would .	8
Could we just go over one or two more ...	2
So what else is new ?	2
When Mr [PERSON]'s feet hurt , he drives the whole house crazy .	4
I demand that you free the Childlike Empress !	1
We're not going to risk a massive lawsuit .	4
He wants to meet with you . Today . - Why ?	2
This is a bullshit case .	1
That must have been very nice .	5
If we lose , get out of town quick .	1
And Miss [PERSON]'s waiting .	2
You boys hungry ?	2
Come on , what are you fellows gaping at ?	1
Your mama was fine .	8
Maybe I wanted to see your face naked , no guard up , how you really felt hoping I would be wrong about something that I knew my entire life .	3
Open your eyes !	1
Self - experimentation is against the rules of good research .	1
I want to talk to you guys for a second .	8
I hate you !	1
Mean gene : He's coming back , Ladies and gentlemen .	2
This time , in sight of my goal , it seemed as if I must meet defeat .	6
She'll lend you an air of respectability if that's possible .	8
I'm not asking you , I'm telling you . You're in danger .	1
[PERSON] . Thank you .	8
He's all tired out , though , the poor little guy .	6
Can I have a Scotch and soda ?	2
I got ta stay with her .	8
When the boat seemed a safe distance from the shore , I took a spike , and drove it again and again through the planking of the hull .	4
Also , I'm in love . I. . . I'd like to get married .	2
I got shoes . Wan na see ?	2
We know next to nothing about them except we believe they're connected to the Hezbollah .	4
I am . I love you so much .	5
This can be established .	8
He must have a plan .	8
I was so close .	5
Herb ?	7
How you hate the villain .	3
Do you understand now why it is so important to me for you to believe that I love you with all of my heart ?	8
Fucking gas company .	1
I never saw a more gross neglected duty in my life .	3
Well , I can not accuse you Of not making us comfortable , Captain .	1
Much happier .	5
You come in and sit a minute with me .	8
Why don't you just go ?	2
Uh , [PERSON] ? Here .	7
Well , you're so good at fixing things maybe you'll fix me a light .	8
What a pleasure .	5
And if there's anything else you want , just holler .	1
I'll disinherit him .	1
You are far prettier than I ever imagined .	5
We got 'em !	2
Can't I do what I think is right ?	4
I wanted to blame myself even for the man who had taken me .	6
You've no right to think what you do about me .	1
It is not usually he writes to me .	6
Now , listen , stow the chatter , mate , and get on that banjo .	1
Amine , can you hear me ?	4
[PERSON] , we've got a serious problem .	4
But I can order with the best of 'em .	8
What he did was , he just took my money .	1
I'm an old man who will live until I die .	6
Any guy who says he can fence $ 50,000 , is crazy .	7
All I'm saying is maybe all the child needs is to be loved .	2
That Miss [PERSON] is about the prettiest girl I ever did see .	5
How do I know you'll jump ?	4
And that's why I don't wan na talk about it if I don't have to .	1
That old man is a sick character .	3
Admiral know what that is ?	7
You see how much we accomplish when you appear ?	2
The Cold War is over , Mrs. Acting President .	8
That should give you the real overview of where we're headed .	2
I hope you have a nice stay in [LOCATION] .	2
Anyway , the president of this teamster local back east set up a phony welfare fund , right ?	3
She ain't gonna talk , man .	1
That was incredible .	5
Please I don't want anyone to be bad to my wife .	4
You got ta get them bones growing .	2
Did somebody say chase  ? 	7
You should have a kid , [PERSON] .	3
Silence , [PERSON] !	6
What happened ? Where are the others ?	4
It's gonna be very dangerous .	4
Is this our new car ?	2
I forgot about it .	7
I wonder what he's doing with Mr [PERSON] .	7
Now , your gallant Maj. [PERSON] is selling me a phony . So he deserves whatever he gets .	3
Come on , [PERSON] . We got ta move !	1
Probably not .	1
Maryk showed me a log he had written on [PERSON]'s behaviour .	1
Oh , no , don't worry about me .	8
Humans are dumb .	3
Who reported it ?	7
Rock , go !	2
Ted , thanks .	8
Carry on , men .	8
Skinny popped him .	3
I might get bit , after all .	2
Hey ! It's [PERSON] .	2
[PERSON] would get a shot every half hour so he could die without pain .	6
You've always had to work ?	7
Yeah . Just call me . - When ?	2
Good luck , Mom .	8
She's a wonderful wife to me , too .	5
I won't let it happen .	1
But come sit for a minute .	1
The sunsets were pink ...	5
Tri Face !	7
I - I took some sleeping pills .	6
Oh my God !	7
It hurts , hurts , hurts .	6
You're the experts .	8
You will be cooperative ?	2
I feel I should be doing something , but I don't know what .	4
Give me that !	1
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law .	1
In six months , we'll have the finest drill team in the world .	2
Fucking cannibal .	3
Barney ! [PERSON] , what a day .	5
I got a hunch [PERSON] ain't got his mind on his business .	1
Neighbors like each other , speak to each other , care if anybody lives or dies .	4
I'd really like to help you .	8
Because I'm still tired .	6
But at least try my way first .	2
You know , you're expecting too much from that formula of B - 4 , Mr Oxly .	3
I like doing business with a man I can trust .	8
I get to live in a place ... it's OK . Don't get me wrong . The air is clean .	5
That's great , eh ?	5
That does it .	5
I don't want her hurt at all .	6
Yours ?	2
What ? !	7
It was a pleasure to have the general here .	5
If it's new committee assignments you'd like , we can certainly arrange that .	8
Look , your mother is here .	7
We've had wonderful times , we three .	5
We should celebrate this with a bottle of wine .	2
I find it really insulting that you assume it has to be a guy .	3
But it's not real .	7
For God's sake , listen to me !	1
Look what I found !	7
She must've struck something .	7
I appreciate that , sir .	8
Boys forget what their country means by just reading  Land of the Free  in history books .	3
If only you knew how anxious I am to talk to you .	4
Great view . I bet you can see all the way to the ocean from out here .	5
I couldn't do anything .	6
I shot him .	1
They hurt you any , [PERSON] ?	1
[PERSON] , this is Al.	7
Nobody can do that , ... Except you .	1
Was a [N-WORD] ?	7
What that child got to stand , the good Lord give her strength to stand .	6
Did you see that ?	7
We have a tremendous audience here At global television studios ,	5
Anyway , what's it matter to you ?	1
Look , there's something weird going on here , and I can't quite follow it .	4
But , she can be very generous sometimes .	8
It's high time I told [PERSON] a thing or two .	1
It's a deal .	8
And the only way we got of holding 'em off is by getting together .	1
I mean , all you have to do is to step aside with immense fortune .	8
Without a wind , we'll lose him !	1
This is true , [PERSON] .	8
It will happen , as it does for all of us .	2
It affects her every day .	6
You're the first good thing that's happened to us .	5
We'll make the deal .	8
Outstanding .	5
I do not know what you are , but you are not a woman .	3
Listen , I really can't talk about this over the phone .	1
Where were you ?	2
I don't give a damn .	1
I don't know . We just ... became friends . And then it became more than that .	6
That'll stop him !	1
Now , the police are gonna want me to let some of you go as a sign of good faith .	8
You lose the feel of the cards when you have so much action ... day in and day out .	6
Ever since the club split up , I missed you . We all missed you .	8
Did you sleep well ?	8
C'mon , rest awhile girl .	1
As I said , sir it all depends how far we're willing to go .	4
I'm tired .	6
I've never been happier in my life .	5
Junior !	5
Well , I want to thank you and your wife for all your help .	8
We're counting on you .	8
Aren't you ever satisfied ?	7
No , no , no , no , no , I want to know what the hell is happening to me !	1
Before the bomb went off yesterday , do you recall seeing this man ?	7
I hope you'll enjoy this .	2
We'll share it .	8
So , I guess I was the lucky one .	5
I'm sorry you have to sneak out by the back way , but we must preserve a respectable front .	8
One can learn a great deal from him .	8
Don't be tricked by his devilish voice !	3
What good is it to cut off your heads ?	3
Sorry , coach .	6
Not going to do it .	1
This is nice .	5
They ain't going to expedite it for me .	1
We came outside giddy and reeling .	4
Good job .	5
I'm glad you told me about this .	5
I decline to answer your question . I decline to answer your question .	1
And I know this planet is safer because she's defending it .	8
My point is there is a protocol with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children .	8
Don't question my decisions again .	1
I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you , but I want you to tell me the truth .	8
No luck ?	7
It's tough being left out , isn't it ?	6
Don't ask me why .	1
He was very understanding .	8
She's going to die if you don't help me .	4
Now come on , you've been drinking .	3
Why did you lie to me ?	1
If you become president , would [PERSON] remain as vice president ?	2
Did you bring that guy in here ?	7
They've done things with my body and the bodies of others ...	4
I was in a really bad place .	6
Hey Pops , give me one of those crazy beers .	2
Cheers , man .	5
Yeah , are you gonna feed her ?	1
Just give me the stamp . I love you , [PERSON] , [PERSON] , [PERSON] , [PERSON] , whatever your name is .	8
So why don't you tell me a little about yourself ?	2
I'll be in my office if you need me .	8
This is long , man .	7
To me , man is a tremendous creation , an inconceivable thought .	7
You sound further away than that .	7
So , how is it you know so little about cars ?	7
We have an idea that might help .	2
[PERSON] is army from the anus up .	3
I had no right to put you through all that .	1
What's [PERSON] got to do with this ?	7
What about it ?	2
I get two bucks an hour , plus ten per cent of that goes to a bail fund .	8
Must be very good .	5
You really could be a nun ! Thanks .	5
Then when I'm good and ready , we come out with a big extra .	2
Collaborating with President [PERSON] is always a mistake .	1
Did you see what he did ?	7
Sink that longboat !	1
Thank you for asking .	8
How did you manage to get so friendly with [PERSON] ?	7
Did I hear something about jewels ?	7
Father .	8
I don't like your faces .	3
Well , now where are you going ?	2
Your back prevented you from practicing six hours a day .	1
If I don't get a room , you and your hotel are fourth on my list to be sued !	1
No worries .	8
Fracture that whole part of the world , and now we have ISIS .	1
I knew there was a story in that guy .	2
So , the ring ? - No .	7
Sing something , [PERSON] . Wonderful idea !	5
I have no basis and no standing to move forward if I did .	1
They're poorly !	3
I'll get on it first thing .	2
I am going to throw up .	6
Well , as long as you feel that way about it , the gun is yours !	1
Jesus ... - Christ on a crutch .	3
Get ready . We need you to drop something off .	8
Okay , I need you to calm down , okay ?	8
I've been having weather problems .	6
Whatever action needs to be taken to address this problem , needs to be taken .	1
I'm just following orders But don't worry	8
So , should we still listen to what Elder says ?	1
She'll talk about the Triad robbery , she'll name Case , then us .	2
But right now , I can't think of one .	7
Please . - Could you get [PERSON] a Coke , please ? - Sure .	2
What's so odd about that ?	7
What do you skin ?	2
How long has she been gone ? ! How long ?	7
I won't ever do it again , I promise .	6
I'm not kiddin' around .	6
Stay out of sight .	1
Be ready to leave on the night train for [LOCATION] .	2
Why would a dumb Polack like you think he could outsmart someone like me ?	3
I'm just fine .	5
Because she can't stand him !	1
I'm your man . Come anywhere near my old lady , I'll cut your balls off , asshole .	1
One good thing .	5
I mean , about my having this floor to go on with my babbling .	1
You took away my czar , my country , my people .	1
I asked him especially , and he told me to tell you .	8
Do you expect me to believe this ?	7
I don't think you'll be able to stand it long .	6
Well , the tall guy is not really a friend .	3
He tried to knife me .	4
Can I just leave my underwear ?	1
Well , I must say you're quite different from what I expected .	7
Get away from that wood !	1
I'm clearing out of that office everything I own .	1
I think you're all being unfair .	1
If they do come here , you will let me know ?	2
Okay . All right !	5
Not even a perhaps or a maybe ?	7
Sounds right to me . OK .	5
Beautiful . - Uh-huh . Yeah .	5
We've to get out of here and get help !	4
We'll have to hope that that's enough .	2
Mr. [PERSON] ? You all right ?	2
We lost [PERSON] !	4
You are a class - A fuck - up , you know ?	1
Something I can do to help you ?	8
I saw those guys coming towards [PERSON]'s house just before we got out .	4
I mean you're gonna find it kind of hard to drive without any keys .	4
I'm gonna do it now .	8
Not me .	1
You're sure of that , are you ?	8
On !	2
How many times have I told you to keep away from my desk ?	1
I'm coming to you .	2
He'll know how to handle things .	8
What about us ?	4
Don't you believe it .	7
You named it .	7
Your gutless hide is safe .	1
How does he end his letter ?	2
Here , rally round and I'll show you the points of interest .	2
I want to talk to my brothers .	2
With a ring like that I could , dare I say it , rule the world .	8
He's a good man .	8
Not your fault , don't think that .	6
And ten minutes later I got the call ... that the court had found in our favor .	2
What kind of car ?	7
You conning him out of the deed without putting down a cent .	3
Yeah , you fucking coward !	1
You don't have to call me Father .	8
Listen , I got an idea .	2
Isn't this the same desk ... ?	7
Please . Understand I was taken by surprise .	7
No , sir .	1
Press down on her !	1
So you don't know what happened .	4
May success follow your flag .	8
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine .	2
I think it was fun and sexy .	5
lmprovise .	8
Please just look at me .	1
Boss , you think of everything .	8
Are we ?	2
Well , I will be very glad to hear it .	5
I like her .	5
I don't need marked cards to beat you , pal .	1
He'll show you when it's finished .	2
She was worried about you .	4
A little early for Christmas shopping , ain't it ?	2
You'll never get me to give this up !	1
It's not exactly the Ritz , but it's peaceful and quiet .	5
You little spying ' hyena . Did the professor put you up to this ?	3
Sort of .	6
You make me sick when you speak , [PERSON] .	3
But we've got to take a closer look at this big boy .	2
The best , smartest , most interesting women in the world ?	7
No need to worry , son .	8
Come on , it's me , [PERSON] .	2
Why would anyone recognize me ?	7
So what do we do about the hostage situation , sir ?	4
You broke your husband out of prerelease ?	7
What the blaze is going on here ?	4
I hate that cheap little bastard .	3
But , of course , she's lying .	1
Well , it can't be helped now .	6
Very nice , [PERSON] .	5
And treat those two impostors Just the same ...  	1
You know this guy !	8
It just makes me feel real glad to see the Chiefs back on the warpath again ... to coin a phrase .	5
Is this the kind of person that you are ?	7
No , I think it's a lot more exciting than that .	2
It doesn't fear my incantations !	5
We should go .	2
Mister , is this Heaven here or not ?	7
Hey , they're ... they're shutting the door .	4
Can't you humor him ? I need a favor .	1
You still serve that dull , grey stupidity .	3
Don't you understand ?	7
Specialist to the nursery .	8
I think [PERSON] was kind of cute .	5
Put it down	1
We got to find [PERSON] .	2
Everything's gonna be okay .	8
Who's got time to wonder what happened to some ridiculous talking mice when you're driving by at 75 , miles an hour ?	1
I was state - raised ... and this is a dead place .	6
Keep it down , you'll wake the munchkins !	1
I wouldn't be stupid enough to bring it home .	1
We'll let him sleep .	8
It pretends this man is in danger when no one cares about him one bit .	3
He doesn't have your heart .	3
You take care of these people .	8
They screwed him up .	1
Why did you take him then with me ?	7
Whether we live or die may depend on what happens here .	4
He knows , what I do not understand it is for what reason the Inglethorp it seemed so interested in being a prisoner .	7
The three so - called flying saucers had been recovered in [LOCATION] .  	4
You know I told you that [PERSON] and I are going to get married ... when he comes back from the maneuvers .	2
I hope to see more of you , when you're free of the spell of Mr. [PERSON] .	2
What did he say ?	2
That's part of the picture .	5
Are you crying ?	6
Well , I can't help wondering if [PERSON] is right .	7
Stand by and see his wife insulted ?	3
I was thinking of picking up a pizza and going home .	2
Ah ! - You should listen to your brother .	1
Now you can show Papa some of them tricks .	2
I'll see to it .	8
What's weak about wanting ?	3
And we're finished playing the key cities .	2
Yes , sir .	8
I didn't mean to offend you . I was just being me , you know ?	6
I've been doing some checking on you , Mr. [PERSON] .	8
( isaac crying ) - it's cranky time .	6
bat - blind ships .	3
You're the busiest woman I ever saw .	8
How could he , A young , inexperienced priest , Do battle alone with the dark lord himself ?	1
And don't forget , there are two things that have no limit :	1
You look different .	6
Good heavens , isn't there any revolt in you ?	7
Just get the head .	1
Drop that gun and let me walk out .	1
Just let me take her back with me .	8
She'll listen to you , you're not her mother .	1
You could change decent and decent . Go straight .	1
It's wasted on this bunch of Swiss bankers .	3
Actually , I kissed you because I couldn't control myself	6
Whatever I lost , I lost a long time ago , and I don't plan on losing more .	6
Next time remind me to bring some aspirin .	2
Everybody's a screwball in some way .	3
Sorry for the slight inconvenience , Your Honor .	8
They threatened to kill me if I didn't pay .	4
Hey , daddy's friends are here .	5
What are you talking about , dad ,	1
I'm trusting you to be discreet .	8
Move , I tell you .	1
All killed ?	4
Looking for [PERSON] ?	2
Now , this is pretty great .	5
Yes , of course .	8
[PERSON] said she couldn't go out tonight , so I said she could use the parlour .	6
Something wrong ?	4
What do you call it ?	2
Give it to me !	1
I don't think you should drive .	3
So , we have bought a little time to locate [PERSON] .	2
Certainly you would give any information you had on a case ... To your investigating staff ? Certainly .	8
Okay , everybody out . The party's over .	1
I want some orange juice , eggs , bacon , toasted muffin and lots of coffee .	2
They saw something they weren't supposed to see .	7
So , don't try any funny business .	1
No , you can't leave , you're like the coolest thing about this place .	5
Hope that some help comes .	8
you ever make me look stupid , you're dead .	1
I'm telling you , this cocksucker's trouble .	1
Don't make me shoot you .	1
What a waste of talent .	3
Everything else stops ...	4
How did you do that ?	7
It concerns me !	1
Last night was not so good .	6
I'm afraid I've disappointed you .	6
They were wonderful .	5
That sounds worse than it was .	4
Which future has God , if there is a God , chosen for man's destiny ?	2
What does Molto have to do with this ?	7
That don't do us any good .	6
I'm glad she's on my side .	5
If he starts convincing those senators , you might as well blow your brains out !	1
Your refusal to speak to me is tediously immature , [PERSON] .	3
Here ... the Revolution started .	2
Darn it , [PERSON] .	1
I think [PERSON] does make sense .	8
How about that ? Hey , you're pretty handy to have around , kid .	5
Bingo . You've got a right to open your collar , take off your shoes and relax in [LOCATION] for the rest of your life .	8
I think I'll be just fine .	8
I'll fix you something to eat and call [PERSON] and tell him we're not coming .	1
? On nights like this with the moon above ?	5
One cop per car ?	7
Well , I'll fly down to [LOCATION] in the morning and feel them out .	2
Get out of my office .	1
l 'm in love with this baby that I'm carrying . 	5
That you don't want to live here , or in [LOCATION] , or [LOCATION] , or any other place where people have to live on top of each other , and they don't have enough room to walk , or breath , or smile .	3
How you doing , cowboy ?	2
You won something , did you ?	5
I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again .	4
From this moment it is death to him who wears the ring .	4
Are you drinking my coolers ?	1
That's good . He's bringing his grandson . He's grooming him to take over .	8
You mean you haven't even heard from him ?	7
You seem easily impressed by numbers , captain .	8
Might wash some of the starch out of you , or rust .	3
What are you gonna do there ?	4
The ship's packed with Muslim pilgrims , which could present a hostage situation .	4
General , our discoveries will change the outcome of the war .	2
It was a gift from an admirer who said I was always late .	5
It ... it's gonna be okay .	8
Did you light the hearth in my room ?	2
Yes .	8
Willie , you look worried .	4
Birth of some issues right there .	4
So how can you tell the difference ?	7
That's why it's a good idea to get boys out of the crowded cities for a couple of months of the year .	2
We think we got our Jack the Ripper .	2
The show goes on in five minutes !	2
How about it , kid ?	2
Well , that's good to hear .	5
There are you , free to come and go as you please , and you choose to stay here .	8
A man who would come here as a virgin .	3
I know how much that hurts .	6
You want to know what a real criminal is , [PERSON] ?	2
But you were never there for me , Dad .	6
Mayday !	5
I'd like to see the rest of the guns now .	2
I've missed you .	6
What did you say , you bow - tied freak ?	7
But it's very good !	5
It looks ridiculous with that coat he's got on .	3
How romantic .	5
Who do you think you're punishing , huh ?	1
Bloody woman .	3
I'm warning you ...	1
Well , I'm here to have a dialogue .	2
And denied .	1
At bottom she's a very dull girl and the life she pictures for herself is the life she belongs in .	6
When you can see into this crystal , then you will be ready .	2
I don't want to get shot .	4
Don't worry about a thing .	8
She'd come back , soaked to the skin , but always with the same excuse :	3
Meaning what ?	1
We're getting a lot of heat from parents ' groups .	1
Have a good day , honey .	8
How could you let her do a thing like this ? What ?	1
[PERSON] , executive producer of Kitchen Sink and now , L.A. Beat .	8
Fucking bitch !	1
Did you have a warrant to search his trunk ?	1
Remember how white and fluffy she used to be after I gave her a bath ?	5
I think you really love me .	5
I have to go to rehearsals .	2
Well done !	5
Wouldn't this be faster ?	7
It's a wonder we make a profit at all .	7
Have you been drinking ?	2
You better be home tonight , you [GAY SLUR] .	1
You had plain , decent , everyday common rightness .	8
Oh tots , I'll keep that in mind .	8
He ever , uh ... touch you ?	4
Terror tactics , man .	4
We're going to raise towers of glass and steel .	2
You don't understand .	7
You wan na teach me how to handle my own daughter ?	1
Because you talked me into this , that's why , you idiot !	1
No , let's not risk it . OK .	8
I got troubles of my own .	6
If you know where she is , I beg you to tell me now before it's too late .	1
If you ask me , this is the worst case of downright rudeness I've seen .	3
I thought he didn't drink .	7
You're sorry ?	6
Altitude !	4
It's nothing . - Nothing at all .	6
You can not come to the hospital , [LOCATION] .	4
It's an amazing place . I really like coming here .	5
I just got this brainstorm in the middle of the night and ... funny how that happens sometimes .	7
But you can't .	6
You can't even call ? We'll be stashed away .	1
I'm blowing this place .	1
You murdered your own god , by accident .	3
Thank you , Admiral [PERSON] .	8
We're talking about two minutes of film . Two minutes out of .	2
It's gonna be a treacherous hike .	4
I'm against it .	1
What about the herd ?	2
Now if we want to survive we've got to fight back , we can't hide anymore .	4
I know a lot of nice girls .	5
I'm not very good at that .	6
Look after my things .	8
I invited you .	2
No , I don't even want to do that .	1
We're prisoners of war .	6
But if you do not work hard you will be punished .	3
I wish for you to have a heart .	8
He don't get it .	1
Do not be afraid .	8
And what happens Tuesday ?	2
Let's try to figure the whole thing out .	2
I'm not scared really .	8
There is nothing I can do .	6
I mean , didn't you feel like A complete piece of gutless , spineless , Primordial slime ?	3
He's not coming back .	1
If there's any justice , let him get mugged by the man who took my watch !	1
What about the treasure ?	2
The train's slowing down . How far to the station ?	4
He's alive !	5
Your boat , my boat .	8
Then there's no hope .	6
Would there still be a court file on this case ?	2
I won't vote on it until I get my questions answered .	1
They're gonna need a fucking wrecking ball to take me out of here .	1
I need something something that can fly and that can scare the pants off anything living in that castle .	4
How did [PERSON] and the newspapers get the [PERSON] story before you ?	7
Look , I ain't got no more to say to you , OK ?	1
Do you know that my first trip to [LOCATION] took five days ?	7
What you gonna do about it ?	4
I think she's pretty .	5
Their testimony would make history .	8
She was gonna turn me in .	4
I can not begin to tell you how sorry I am ... That any of this has taken place .	6
Our reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel .	1
It's not what you think . I - I - I would never ... Please , [PERSON] .	4
There never has been a [PERSON] at your hospital .	7
[PERSON] , don't do anything .	4
I'd like your opinion .	8
He went after him like ...	4
These heels are grotesque .	3
That's unacceptable .	3
Will you be blessing this house with your presence for dinner ?	2
Hey , what are you sleeping out here for ?	7
What does my height have to do with anything ?	7
You made Case feel like shit tonight 'cause he was scared .	1
I've got my own life to worry about .	6
And when you win Oscars , both of you , you'll look in the camera and thank me .	8
A hundred years from now , nobody will know the difference .	2
Just get it over with .	1
I don't want it .	1
With a baby , you never know what you're getting .	7

[PERSON] , are you familiar with Article of Navy regulations ?	2
Um , really good to see you , ma'am .	5
I tell you , our side will always win .	8

Too bad the girls are in [LOCATION] .	6
Where ... ?	7
We'll have help up to you real soon .	8
What do you mean , you're downstairs , you idiot ?	1
It's home .	8
It looks different here .	7
We say who , we say when , we say how much .	1
How am I gonna get to first base with this girl ?	4
Take a vacation , let things cool off .	8
Victory over the devil . A great day for mankind .	5
And I don't care whether you go down with him or not .	1
People out there are looting the streets , robbing off hard earners , hard grafters .	3
I'm glad this happened .	5
Do you know how many people are dying ?	4
I know you don't mean any harm , but you are in everyone's way .	1
I think we should talk .	2
Well , [PERSON] will think of something .	2
There's no place out there for graft or greed or lies , or compromise with human liberties .	3
I can't believe it was you on the phone .	7
What , somebody had a saxophone ?	7
You throw double sixes again , and I'll have you burned for a witch .	3
I'll be glad to do it .	5
Why , [PERSON] , it was my idea to give a party for [PERSON] .	2
Fight for real !	1
We sent the messages !	1
He'll have to be committed ....	4
Father , is it all over ?	4
Do Russians never think about life ?	7

Fine . You win .	8
Glad to see you .	5
You better talk to her now .	1

And let me remind you , we lost two key PA's in one day .	6
[PERSON] , it's me . - Yeah .	7
I need you so much .	8
The whole world sucks .	3
Um ... I'm always getting myself into these kinds of things .	7
We give no quarter to those that are disloyal .	1
Yeah , I dreamt about trains .	5
Were you together ? Yeah .	7
When the war's over , [PERSON] .	2
For chrissake , where did she come up with [PERSON] ?	7
Who the hell are you to ask all these questions ?	1
Boy , wait'll they see what we found .	2
It's great , Meat , it's great .	5
He disappeared a long time ago .	6
Maybe they're buddies after all .	8
I could take care of you , [PERSON] , if you'd let me .	8
You'll never mean anything but misery to any man .	6
He's enjoying it ! Can't you see he's enjoying it ?	5
You're here to repent your sins , is it ?	8
You're doing great .	5
I got nothin' to lose .	1
Go to bed at night happy and then murdered .	3
The bite ... was mine .	4
It's all so horrible , isn't it ?	4
I don't have to get any place but out . Share a cab ?	2
I fancy something a bit sporty . - That one .	2
Call it off , [PERSON] .	1
So you and me are gonna make a little arrangement .	8
Honey , it's nice to have somebody take care of you .	5
She had my finger , you know ...	4
Perhaps this was the one step too far .	6
[PERSON] , you trust me , don't you ?	8
I think my cessna is safer anytime .	8
Look , we don't need him .	1
Make us a cup of tea , [PERSON] .	2
Oh , that's what you're working on ?	7
I'll keep her off the screen . I'll destroy her . No .	1
I know we can work through the petty stuff .	8
Oh Mr. [PERSON] , everything ok ?	4
If I didn't know better , I'd think you didn't like it here .	1
Emily , why are you still using your mother's phone ?	1
It kills many brave men .	6
See ? See ? See ?	2
I view with alarm the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady .	3
I want you to be on fucking guard , man .	1
May I help you ?	8
With the speechwriting , I don't want to do it anymore .	6
I'm gonna get that bastard .	1
You say you're sorry and we'll let you go .	6
The ponies were dying .	6
I've decided to go to [LOCATION] , just like I made it up in a story .	2
Merry Christmas .	5
All right , gentlemen . Stand by .	8
You know , with them new suits they're makin' , I bet they helping ' the sun tan oil sales ... all that skin to cover .	3
[PERSON] ? What kind of a name is that ?	7
Senator [PERSON] decided this with you ?	7
[PERSON] knew his way around the old neighbourhoods .	8
Well , I sure do appreciate you boys busting me out .	8
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested , I would .	1
Give me the suit , right now .	1
We'll owe her .	8
That is the most ridiculous thing I ever heard in my life .	1
Wait ! His troops are still out there	7
Now she's going back today , soon as we give 'em a full stomach to travel on .	2
Mind if we ask who the hell you are ?	1
You're a detective now ?	7
When does it happen ? When ?	2
That butcher , Eggers , he'll take 35 , head ... and butcher them himself .	3
One last thing . If you could return this to [PERSON]'s for me , please ?	8
I can pull it out and let you take a whip _ if you'd like .	8
Oh , I'm sure it was just a nightmare .	4
What if you have to back to the castle ?	4
Look , is there someplace that we could go and talk ?	2
You know how it is .	8
Banks today have got to be careful .	4
Who says ? - It's just so , [PERSON] !	7
A hundred of these are produced every day and sent to sweatshops where urban slaves prepare this poison for our friends , our loved ones , our children .	3
Cheers .	2
You mean I can't have me no credit to grow me no crop this year ?	1
? Happy blessings to you God blessings to you ?	5
Don't tell [PERSON] this .	1
[PERSON] did everything he could , but they got away .	6
You really believe you can frighten me ?	7
What a surprise to see you .	7
Maybe you're sorry you married me now , [PERSON] .	6
But you still haven't answered me .	1
I'm not gonna give him any help unless he needs it .	1
It's been an honor to serve with you .	5
Oh , don't say that !	1
That's - that's very kind of you . I hope that you and your wife were - were not uncomfortable .	8
I remembered why I loved paintings in the first place , what got me into this .	5
Oh my God ! You totally should .	7
I'm going to have to leave the country if I ever want a breath of air .	4
Do something with yourself for pity's sakes .	3
If you want him to die , shoot now .	4
Who you think you're messing with , you dumb animal ?	1
That's no way to remember him .	6
You must tell me a few of them .	2
How dare you , you ... How long has she been in this condition ?	1
Also , I don't like nobody touching me .	3
This is a whole new world to me .	5
Yeah , I'd love a cold beer .	2
As you know , over here , crime is not exploited to sell newspapers .	8
Yeah , a beer , please .	2
And what she did was she ... Brought her into a life of hell .	4
I must go .	6
Come here , quick !	2
Yeah , I think you would be decent , With all that account balance bullshit .	8
I don't see myself in one of those bullshit nine - to - five jobs .	1
I knew there'd be a catch to this .	4
You can't arrest me here .	1
It was terrible . He screamed with fear .	4
If you , Miss [PERSON] , know of any proof about aliens , you can give it to me and I guarantee you I will get it out , but I am skeptical .	8
[PERSON] , what's the most recent communication we've received ?	2
Violence prone , obsessive / compulsive personality , a history of excessive physical force throughout his years as a [LOCATION] police officer .	3
You're a month early for the book fair .	1
[PERSON] says he didn't rent a car . The rental company says he did . Whatever .	1
Now that particular statement really pissed me off , because I don't think Congress did any such thing .	1
Will succeed .	8
I just came over to share my happiness with you , [PERSON] .	5
And we take care of our own here .	8
Hey , I'm a mama .	5
Don't bother to get up I'll take care of myself	8
Easy .	8
We have so much .	5
Pecmans ? Buttissimo ? Ah , the old abba dabbas	7
One more word and I'll cut you down !	1
He was very clever , so it was very hard to find out about .	7
I promise you that .	8
If that's true ... this should be very exciting .	2
You know what I'll do in the morning ?	2
I want to hear everything you've been doing .	2
[PERSON] is with [PERSON] .	8
Did you hear that , honey ?	7
Can't shoot a kid , can you , fucker ?	1
You don't get the truth in the Senate .	1
We don't want none of his gratitude !	1
You are a coward like all other people , aren't you ?	3
They say it is the skin of a dead snake .	3
Jesus . Yes , this is me .	7
She's got a witch's brain .	3
Can I get you a drink ?	2
I wan na go home .	2
I carried you in here when you were a baby .	8
We could pick it up on the way home .	2
Way too much weird stuff goes on here .	3
I'm gonna be good , you wait .	2
Mind out , cuz .	1
The usual , sir ?	2
Oh , he ain't alone .	8
Take him !	1
He was here ?	7
How was [LOCATION] ?	2
Do you see how this affects [PERSON] ? You don't ?	7
We won't leave this palace alive .	1
You stupid lizard ! Get off me !	1
The girl you thought you knew was quite nameless and without reality .	3
Hello , sweet thing .	5
It's not right . I'm gonna go check it out .	1
They're harmless , friendly , and , by all reports , extremely intelligent and sophisticated .	8
As he waves to the crowd , you can hear the tremendous cheer !	5
My God , she's coming inside . Oh , God .	4
I don't want to start rehashing everything .	4
But it's bleeding ?	4
Hey , no !	4
We'll catch 'em sooner or later .	2
Get us some frickin' pretzels or something .	2
Am I , [PERSON] ? - No .	4
That's much better .	5
He was generous .	8
It was no self - defense , [PERSON] took him out .	1
He was a loser too .	3
You get your ass over there , Gate .	1
What did he tell you to tell me ?	1
Is it , perhaps , that this cause is too hopeless ?	6
Bathing suits looked awfully funny 100 , years ago .	5
You sleep in till noon , then you watch [LOCATION] and Bullwinkle .	2
What'll it be ?	2
[PERSON]'s depending on you , [PERSON] .	8
I know you're all right ... and a good woman at heart , even though you might have took a wrong turn in life .	8
Well , I reckon I'm in .	2
Out ! Get out !	1
We throw ourselves at your mercy .	1
We thought you'd be safer on the ground .	7
Just put me through on the phone , [PERSON] . Goddamn it !	1
I'm cold .	6
Since you're their representatives , I can tell you that I'm prepared , right now , to give you a [PERSON] .	8
The belle from hell Versus the dove from above In a one - soul , anything goes match - up , [PERSON] .	2
Come say hello to [PERSON] . Have you met ?	2
Go get him , Dad !	1
What the fuck ? !	1
There were bodies that were involved with some of these crashes .	4
He's taken it again !	1
With this strike they've no way home , and there's not a room in the city .	4
Still working on my dissertation at my age . It's ridiculous .	1
If you think I'm the kind to mess with anybody comes along ...	1
I'm afraid of you ?	4
The Kid will have to play him .	2
They have a craving for human flesh .	3
He wants clean people on the screen for himself and his children to look at .	3
Don't give me that . I know enough about weights and measures to know holes aren't allowed , no corrective holes .	1
[PERSON]'s people were ready to go , but the FSB replaced the crew .	6
Get the hell up because I'm out here alone .	1
Are you out of your mind ?	1
I'll break it to her gently .	6
Background , [PERSON] . Tell me about it .	2
Freeze !	1
Hop on , no time to lose .	8
I'm going to be next week .	2
See anything you like ?	2
What kind of a deal is this ?	7
I know about abnormal behaviour .	3
We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange .	4
I love the smell of commerce in the morning !	5
That is ridiculous .	1
Yeah , she'll wind up fat , alcoholic and miserable .	6
What other reason could there be ?	7
Remote and useful .	8
I change cars like other guys change their fuckin' shoes !	1
And now , a happy surprise for all of us .	5
Time's over for drifters and outlaws and those who got no backbone .	3
You're going to Harvard and you're gonna be a doctor .	2
I think there's a lot of planets out there .	2
I told you not to count it .	1
For the hospital , for the seriously sick .	4
I got a surprise for you tonight .	2
Look how big it is !	7
I want them booked on felony charges , destruction of private property , and assault .	1
We are witnessing the making of a legend , [PERSON] , the kind of thing that front covers are made of .	5
The most beautiful TV personality , Miss [PERSON] !	5
I had fights ... . . and every one of 'em I was scared , so yeah , you know , that's real , real normal .	8
You will pay me back what you owe , with interest .	8
Come right in .	2
Very nice of him , though .	5
Yes , I noticed you'd packed .	7
Well , actually ...	7
Get that piece of pigshit out here .	1
Dear Senator , have you got any idea what it takes to get a bill passed ?	2
I want some more beer .	2
There will come a time , when those who sit above me will want you delivered .	2
That night I got a grip on life again .	6
She's fainted .	4
Put them back .	1
Tell me the whole story from the beginning .	2
At my age , you got ta think about retiring .	6
It felt good .	5
That's why your wife dumped you .	3
Liar !	1
[PERSON]'s going to help with my chemistry .	8
I've never known anyone as capable and intelligent .	7
It's out ! - Are you all right ?	4
Take that sentence back !	1
He reached out to us and asked if we'd be willing to help him	8
[PERSON] , I can't subpoena those records without a legitimate client .	1
My back's giving me hell .	1
[PERSON] won't see her kids again .	6
He hit me .	4
Your beloved business manager , [PERSON] the man you stayed with , the one I begged you to leave ....	6
Put this on .	1
You think I like playing sick little games with you ?	3
I am broke , desperate and very pissed .	4
If [PERSON] found out , it would kill her .	4
( sighs ) I thought I got some good news .	6
I warn you , if this case comes to trial , it will be before a French court .	4
Consuella is right .	8
But the water was dangerously low ?	4
Just feel how nice it is in here .	5
And as for taxes , how many millions have you in tax - exempt bonds and oil wells , whose power of production your government so generously protects , while it denies similar benefits to the human brain ?	1
How come she leave that job ?	7
Oh , very good !	5
I was getting a message for you .	2
I think it's brilliant .	5
You taught me everything .	8
Particularly child trafficking .	3
I'm so sorry .	6
[PERSON] , you must be mistaken .	8
When we first went there , [PERSON] , he could barely speak .	6
We've been through this !	1
The only ones who see a UFO on TV programs are the rednecks .	3
Why , her last words were about you .	1
Home team .	8
I just wish I could tell him how much I appreciate this .	6
You can hold the frog .	8
Let's sing !	2
He says he doesn't want presents , but you know him .	8
Christ .	1
With who ?	7
A man dropped you off unconscious . Who ?	7
I was afraid of that .	4
[PERSON] asked me if I wanted to see him again .	2
Let's get something to eat .	2
How can you have the gall to compare the conflict here in [LOCATION] with a glass of cappuccino coffee ?	1
I was getting lonely upstairs , all by myself .	6
I'll speak with you first .	2
Allow me to get that bag for you .	8
So the basic problem is that I'm still around ?	7
Everyone wanted to do the oral argument , that's always kind of the cherry on top of the ice cream there .	5
[PERSON]'s divorce left him in a state of disorder .	6
Pick you up in an hour .	2
I told you , this can get tough .	4
They'll destroy you .	4
Four degrees down !	1
Here , at least , I'm a little star .	5
Any day now the doctors say they may find the antitoxin .	2
These little rascals make life worth living .	3
I would put money on us .	4
Wasn't [PERSON] the sweetest man you ever met ?	5
I wish I were a woman of 36 , dressed in black satin with a string of pearls .	6
They say some of us can turn as late as nine or ten , but I'm past that now so ...	4
Good luck , [PERSON] .	8
I never thought of it ...	7
I'll talk to you later .	2
I do better with women , and they don't eat cigars ...	3
It will be a fine thing to do .	8
Like a velvet glove cast in iron , and like the gas chamber , [PERSON] , a real fun gal .	5
A wonderful day , I think .	5
It's as true now as it was then .	8
I have something I'd like to show you .	2
Bless you . Father , how can I possibly thank you ?	8
[PERSON] , is you going out of your mind ?	1
Jeanne !	5
You can beat it out of me , but it won't do you any good .	1
You and I are such similar creatures .	8
What's this about a film ?	7
We're partnering on a project .	2
It's a big nut to crack .	1
You have to have faith .	8
The Presidential Commission has empowered me to take it in my care .	8
Unless you wanted me to stay .	1
Isn't this exciting ?	5
Men will believe anything , the more preposterous the better .	3
That hurts .	6
Nothing we didn't expect .	7
Let me handle your husband's career and you can live like human beings again .	8
I don't care what you found , boy !	1
The pretty one on the right . I think she likes you .	5
You can hardly expect the jury to believe that a woman in love doesn't attempt to meet her lover .	3
Yes , I confess .	8
Fine .	8
Then you must be his ...	1
I've always thought a lashing with a whip would benefit you immensely .	5
I need to know .	2
Well , young man , you seem to be enjoying yourself .	5
Well , there it is .	5
We've got to leave .	6
That would be nice .	5
This sure is a happy day to me .	5
I hope you lose .	4
I will not go back where I came from , because I do not like it there .	1
Would you call me [PERSON] ?	2
And that's exactly what I'm going to do .	2
There is no other way out , my friend .	8
He was the sanest man I ever knew .	5
You ain't really gonna let them take that baby , are you ?	7
Nobody's on it because she's a junkie , and everything she said to me is in the Lucas Goodwin manifesto , which has been picked apart by every message board and conspiracy theorist on the Internet .	3
I think we're stuck .	4
I thought , l 'm in love . 	5
Keep joshing like that And you're never going to college like your sister here .	1
I know the answer .	8
I know you were deeply touched by [PERSON]'s gesture ,	5
I'd known [PERSON] since I was an altar boy .	8
You a fifty - dollar whore ? - What are you doing ?	1
More importantly , what the hell am I doing here ?	1
[PERSON] , they weren't taking any chances !	1
Now , with such simplicity ... Such clarity , everything falls into place .	5
Help me .	8
We should get rid of anybody that doesn't put the company first .	1
You know , [PERSON] is not gonna last five minutes out there .	1
You look tired , Little Big Man .	6
Right . And the living room nose and the kitchen forehead and den ears .	3
Sir , I was the best swimmer in my course .	5
That might not be the worst of it .	7
I'm a fighter .	8
Fire the security department !	1
You don't care whether I live or die .	1
[PERSON] was the fireball of our little cocoon .	5
Hell , we could bring in the whole god damn New York Knicks just to make sure your trash hits the basket ! How's that ?	1
I just can't believe [PERSON]'s dead .	4
[PERSON] , do you know what you're saying ?	1
I know you're trying to scare me , huh ?	4
You okay ?	4
You do , you look amazing , isabel .	5
Get out of my way , [PERSON] .	1
Mr. [PERSON] , you wan na join the party ?	2
Something hit us .	4
Stand by to torpedo !	1
He told you to tell me that too ?	1
Now , today ...	2
Harry , how did you do it ?	7
Old man , my last name isn't Chow !	7
The Lady herself Inglethorp !	7
I want you to know how sorry I am I had to put you through this .	6
No , no , no .	1
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day ?	7
I think I'm going to go back in and see the movie .	2
Therefore , it must be a metal .	3
No , don't ! Not this one .	1
Nothing will ever happen to me anymore !	1
You're going into the arena alone .	1
I thought I liked to party , but these guys ...	7
I don't give a shit if he knows who killed him or not .	1
You tell him I've got [PERSON] under control .	8
You won't get away with this , Trixie .	1
Is she the one in the painting ?	7
He must be going out of his mind .	6
The good people of [LOCATION] !	5
And , [PERSON] , I want you to get me the CEO of IBC ASAP .	2
It seems there's no formal contract between you and [LOCATION] .	1
I'm glad you're making new friends .	5
The Montauk Club , : pm .	2
I didn't marry her under my real name .	1
[PERSON] , my sympathy for your loss --	6
Sucker !	1
We're not gonna hurt you .	8
The police have road blocks on every main exit from town .	1
It's a nice sentimental gesture , CinCPac sending your old cruiser .	5
I had the most frightening experience .	4
It sounds frightening .	4
Something is breeding there . Underneath the cemetery .	4
There's the finest deerskin jacket I've ever seen .	5
I couldn't agree with you more .	8
It'd be a big help if you could keep an area clear in front of the bridge for us .	8
I couldn't get the cook on such short notice , so we're on our own .	8
You think you know something about law .	8
l 'm in love with a cop from the . 	5
[PERSON] needed my help .	8
It's better than dying in some dirty hotel .	3
The idea that Backpage is just trying to cater to fetishes of old men , doesn't really involve underage children ,	3
[PERSON] is a man of luck .	8
Don't lose a moment .	1
Yes , but when the cash runs out , they'll mob us .	4
Stand here and argue .	1
You said you'd never leave me .	8
[PERSON] , keep that mule's asshole away from me before I have to break him .	1
Oh , I am sorry .	6
All my failings were preparations for meeting you .	1
His ambition has jeopardized the prosperity of the English people .	1
It's like working in a filling station , watching the cars go by .	5
What's he doing there ?	7
Are you guys nuts ?	1
Sure .	8
Today's just taking shit down .	1
Once again skill and daring have overcome fear and anxiety .	8
Take your hands off there , you old fool .	3
You ain't gonna take no car .	1
Fucking come on , then !	1
It's over . Water under the bridge .	4
The Feds are at the lake house , man .	4
Don't leave without saying goodbye .	6
You want fantasy , let's go to my place .	2
A river patrol just fished a girl out of the water .	4
Like hell it isn't .	1
No way [PERSON] is going to talk me into cutting celery again .	1
I don't want to lose you .	6
Don't go to him in anger . Go and warn him .	1
Ah , the ring !	5
What am I gonna do , [PERSON] ?	4
Give me all the covering fire you can spare .	1
Are you willing to take that chance ?	2
Here we go again !	2
You can't leave me here alone .	6
You should have learned by now !	1
I could sure use your help .	8
She was a hooker and made it sound so great .	5
What is it now ?	2
If you have something to say , say it and get out .	1
That's what I pay you for .	8
[PERSON] , why are you so cross ?	7
We're unbeatable .	5
I behaved abominably .	3
They're meeting my first demand .	2
Fucking asshole . I love you .	1
All the good in this world came from fools with faith like that .	3
I cast thee back to hell . To hell !	1
I'll get in trouble !	4
I'm sorry I can't wait here with you , but ...	6
The wise man gets drunk to spend his time with fools .	3
Okay , then let's get going .	2
Why don't you both shut up ?	1
What are you doing ? - Shh .	7
Father . I'm seeing a pattern here .	4
There has seldom been a man so unwise , so headstrong but he could see the necessity of keeping friends and not making enemies at court .	8
Thank you . Good night .	5
Let him go !	1
Let's go get them , baby .	2
Can I ask you something ?	2
Don't nobody want to ask me nothin' ?	7
Have Doc take a look at him .	1
Well , my mother was a music teacher and married my father , whose family was extremely wealthy .	8
You know , I'm getting damn tired of your misplaced admiration .	1
Why don't you shut the hell up ! Crybaby .	1
When will you come back to me ?	2
I don't want to go to [LOCATION] .	6
I - I came to this country to pursue the American dream .	6
Excuse me , Doctor , but that would be a tragic mistake .	4
Can't do what ?	7
They breed like rabbits , don't do any work and expect Welfare to put them on [LOCATION] .	3
I have no idea what to do .	4
[PERSON] , thanks ever so much .	8
I'm going after her .	1
Well , she did sort of embrace it once she did .	5
No , that's not it , give me that chain .	1
It's ... it's gonna take me a while to map out all of her movements .	2
This is [PERSON] , Chief of Homicide Bureau Office of the District Attorney , County of [LOCATION] .	8
As you can see , I'm being relieved of command .	6
Since you're sitting in the corner . You're usually a power table kind of girl .	3
I need to send my thumbprint so they know it's me .	2
You put asses into seats .	3
Please come back , [PERSON] .	4
The best !	5
So , are you going to tell the police ?	4
It's nice to have company for tea .	5
Would you like to dance ?	2
You can't do this to him , or to all the others .	1
Quiet , please !	1
You treat her bad .	3
He got a little sick .	6
[PERSON] turns against me , And I should lighten up ?	4
I don't think I should join your campaign , you know .	1
As for me , I'm just a slave .	6
I'm thinking , I did it .	5
What do you want it to be ?	2
Would you like me to go back and get [PERSON] out ?	8
All that money , [PERSON] ?	7
I wanted to surprise you .	2
You look terrific .	5
Nothing's impossible .	8
I just don't fit behind a desk , I I'm not cut out for it , I feel dry - docked .	6
Oh , no . Come on . You don't know that .	7
That's excellent .	5
You must have had some wonderful experiences in [LOCATION] .	5
He's a bit soft that Inspector , isn't he ?	8
The man ends up looking like his heart attacked him .	6
All you got ta do is run into him .	1
It can only blow up in our faces .	4
I've been missing you a lot lately .	6
Well , I'd say the [LOCATION] money will probably lay about ... oh , 8 - 5 , on [PERSON] .	2
I'm renting a fucking bed - sit , Al.	1
You knew when I point blank asked you , and you lied to me about it .	1
I can't keep this from the president any longer .	1
You don't look excited .	6
You know I'm gonna be the president , right ?	2
I am ready , Mr. [PERSON] .	2
By the time they take the mortgage payments out of my paycheck , there's not enough left to buy you a fuckin' box of tampons !	1
Yeah , I um , I just ... just thought I saw something , but I can't really , um , trust my eyes these days .	4
You murdering fool !	1
Tomorrow , [PERSON] ... My friend and mentor , will testify he thinks I'm guilty .	2
You'll learn quick enough .	8
He is unworthy of command .	3
No , stay there . You must stay .	1
Don't move !	4
Bastards .	1
Will she be back soon ?	2
He's worse than [PERSON] Tex.	3
You got me down in this goddamn water .	1
I don't get your generation's humour .	3
You want us to believe that ?	7
No , you're not listening to me !	1
One time he had the whole cast over from some [LOCATION] show .	5
Well , like I said , right now , I've got a bigger problem .	4
Come on , damn it !	1
What's that got to do with us ?	7
What's your hurry , honey ? He's not gonna run away !	1
No , but he's not feeling well .	6
But we will be still more intelligent .	8
This test may tell us why .	2
That money was going to change my life .	2
So , you're a lawyer now ?	7
It's a dead man .	4
He won't open the safe .	1
I have something inevitable to tell you .	2
I ain't gonna call her any more .	1
I want everything he's got .	1
You can call it an immigration if you want to , [PERSON] .	1
He wasn't worthy of your loyalty .	3
Wouldn't you enjoy that ?	5
All right . Mind your shoving ' , mate .	1
I want to talk to you .	2
Are you able to offer something ?	2
You chickenshit bastard .	1
I can't have that .	1
We know from our fancy telescopes that just in the last years , more than planets have been identified outside our solar system that seem to be far enough from their suns and dense enough that they might be able to support	2
That means we're in grave trouble .	4
Fuck your goddamn cleaner !	1
Yes , I guess it's been a nightmare for you too .	6
I don't have casual affairs .	3
I will .	8
Knows him real well .	8
Bring him to me !	1
In other words , it doesn't hurt a bit .	5
And how about some pepper and salt and vinegar , eh ?	2
I'm a friend of the family .	8
I've got some sandwiches in my pack .	2
Ring it , mate .	1
I'm an actor , see ?	7
Such an honour that you rode my horse !	5
He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens and you with it !	1
Give me a nice big hug , like you used to when you were little .	5
Holy Moses .	7
What was that crack ?	7
Your day is done , old boy .	1
But I'm expecting a courier any minute .	2
How sad .	6
I love this !	5
Because we've lived through it .	6
I bet you don't even like girls , do you ?	3
[PERSON] , you're so ... weird !	7
It seems to me very clear .	8
Now , if Case doesn't kill us , the Triads will .	4
Well , I no longer wish to buy your company and take it apart . I don't want anyone else to either .	6
This is why I have never been able to love anyone else before you .	5
My own husband was killed in this last war .	6
[PERSON] , honey , would you like to freshen up Mr. [PERSON]'s drink a little bit ?	2
The time had come to look the devil in the eye and send him to hell where he belonged .	3
I don't believe what we have done .	6
Now , we better start all over .	2
You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order .	3
They send you champagne .	5
He's lying .	3
And you're gonna ask me questions .	8
If it's OK with you , I'd just like to hold 'em here in my hand .	8
He's being evasive again .	1
ve never been to [LOCATION] L.A.[LOCATION] 	7
He won't eat any steak .	1
I guess one gets the face one deserves .	3
I'm trying , you know it really upsets me .	6
What do you think they're all talking about ,	7
Aren't you supposed to know that ? Isn't that your job ? How could you be stupid enough to let somebody follow you ?	1
They all point to me .	4
I'm not on the pills so we use rubbers , so it's hurting .	6
Stop the presses !	1
Why , you got something ?	7
Sister [PERSON] , you play great game of balls . How come ?	2
Why's she making those funny noises ?	7
I should feed a strange mouth ?	3
I'm gonna love squeezing you out .	5
I was ambitious then .	2
A man's got ta live up to his word .	8
You can't even cook my breakfast .	1
It's a big mistake .	4
Pretty sea . Pretty sand .	5
[PERSON] , I don't know what I'll do when you go .	4
I don't want you smoking in the car tomorrow .	3
Oh , my gosh , you must be [PERSON] !	7
I know all the other teams laugh at me .	5
With her bare hands , she just chopped him down !	1
Ripping out phones , urinating on desks .	3
Mr. [PERSON] loaned me his Bible here so I could practice my reading .	8
Where do they get this crap ?	1
Request permission to leave . - Captain , sir ?	8
Black powder and worse ...	3
Well , we won't stand for it .	1
Tomorrow we begin again .	2
[PERSON] , I came to say goodbye .	6
These two shooters you just brought up from [LOCATION] .	7
It's a better world , we're all bound for .	2
How is that going to look at home ?	7
I was laughing so hard , my drink came out of my nose .	6
They're warming up for it over at [LOCATION] .	2
Did that nickname have anything to do with the typhoon ?	7
This was the most - watched event in the history of the National Press Club .	5
I made reservations at [LOCATION] on [LOCATION] .	2
Of course . Thank you .	8
Jealousy can be destructive .	6
And do remember me kindly to your charming wife .	8
With a little push , we can launch our amphib assault in hours .	2
You wan na help me ? - I'm driving .	4
I've got a job to do , but I'm not hard to get along with .	6
Over my dead body .	6
Hallelujah , brothers !	5
When we invade [LOCATION] , What will the help of [LOCATION] ?	2
I bet you're gonna get a big promotion when this thing's over .	2
His words are too profound	6
Please hurry .	4
Don't cry , honey .	6
The way you say that sounds so ... rote .	7
Happier than we've ever been , yes .	6
Tell [PERSON] 9:[PERSON] , is fine for dinner and see if you can get us into Jams .	2
In fact , I admire the style of you .	5
Just married .	5
I'm your pal .	8
Ah , [PERSON] , old chum .	5
A dollar's a dollar , and every dollar is taking me further West .	4
I am not prepared for wells to run dry !	4
Let me show you to your new house .	2
I don't want any lesson , Shooter .	1
You always do .	8
I'm on my way back to [PERSON] .	2
I'll see you inside the party .	2
We'll keep her here , won't we ?	8
Weren't you , in fact , intimate with the lady ?	7
There's no time !	1
I have a condo with a pool .	5
You mustn't speak to Little Big Man like that .	3
That's a terrible lot of money for a working woman to pay .	3
I've looked all over for shoes like that .	6
Now it's all one big mess .	3
[PERSON] , [PERSON] , [PERSON] .	8
Thank you , thank you , thank you ...	8
The perps are still on the train , okay ?	1
Well , they went to the DA , which means they think you did .	1
Hey , look who's here !	7
You pull one thing , you're out .	1
I'd love to go with you , Mr. [PERSON] .	2
I can see that !	5
I'm ... I'm sorry .	6
Because we belong together .	8
Don't be sure .	4
Don't drink alone .	4
Thanks for coming out here and meeting with him .	8
I'm not ready to retire yet .	6
You better be careful .	4
They're fuckin' horrible - lookin' .	3
You know , maybe it's better you're not staying here .	4
Seriously , must you keep your bicycle in the hall , Father [PERSON] ?	1
And that's the only way to make change , is to make your voice known .	8
We must expose and punish it ...	1
You see that man giving screwface to [PERSON] ?	3
You are ?	7
I don't give the orders , I obey them .	1
This is exactly when we should strike .	2
How stupid .	3
This is okay .	8
Well , I did all my homework .	8
You got him hooked ?	7
You've exceeded everyone's expectations , the way you handled yourself all weekend , but ...	7
What are you accusing me of ?	1
Then you'll finally be rid of me .	1
The poor old governor has to go back to [LOCATION] and live on his pension , right ?	3
What ? What , daddy ?	1
I'd rather negotiate with you any day .	1
Are you saying she was kidnapped ?	7
He shouldn't have to decide here .	1
Give them a taste of their own iron !	1
They laugh and kiss , then they scream and beat each other .	3
And so I turned away my head and wept .	6
Where shall we begin ?	2
Fun but scary .	4
Little Man was very brave .	8
There's a lot of charming people hereabouts , [PERSON] .	5
I'm getting numb all over .	6
I'm moving abroad .	2
Out there , you got me a little wrong .	1
The celebrated list .	5
That's the kind of stuff I like .	5
That might be enough to win this race .	2
As soon as I get it , we'll make tracks .	2
She's very attractive .	5
Oh , is that [PERSON]'s idea ?	7
Why aren't they telling us anything ?	7
It doesn't matter . They run a little family grocery shop back home .	8
Now , please , tell me what I can do .	2
All I'm askin' for is a chance .	2
That's bad management .	1
Yeah , then why are you trying to hurt me ?	1
Come on . I got a schedule to keep .	1
Grow up . Leave your mother .	1
I'm beginning to like it .	5
But he didn't give a shit .	1
With lunch !	2
[PERSON] , [PERSON] man .	8
Got ta have protein . Got ta have eggs .	2
I shall die on the gallows .	6
I admit nothing .	6
I'll do what I can , Mammy .	8
I'm the first to go .	2
Let me give you this watch .	8
The queue was endless .	1
What makes you think we're living in this day and age ?	7
It's to show I love you .	5
Let's go to a nice place .	2
You dumb bastard , why didn't you get some girl off the streets ?	1
[PERSON] has a terrific body .	5
That'll be a good start .	2
I. . . didn't think I'd ever see you again .	6
Yeah , he's bullshit .	1
Let's dance !	2
Good to meet you , Mr. [PERSON] .	5
You couldn't have found anyone more sympathetic to your condition .	8
Look !	7
Bad guy .	1
They had to bring in the coke in wheelbarrows .	1
He's terrific . He's on it .	5
Fuck only knows why [PERSON] lets them in .	1
I'm not investigating her for working for you , I'm investigating her for felony fraud .	1
Oh ! I go there quite often .	5
My heart is packed so full of love for you .	5
[PERSON] , a drink here for my friend .	5
I told you not to pick up the phone .	1
Do you wan na make love ?	2
Taste for fine things .	5
Rosy had eaten and drunk a lot .	3
Or didn't you think magicians could fall in love ?	7
What's that got to do with a train ?	7
Come on , you too !	2
You're going to be one unless you do exactly as I say .	1
Think we should find a rubbish dump or something .	2
There's one on the back , but it's not the right one .	6
Showtime .	2
We're your family now , [PERSON] .	8
He must be in shock . This rush , this adrenaline , the fear .	4
God , I'll lose him .	4
And after dinner we could go ...	2
And anyone who doesn't do right according to nature and my mother I will blow his head off .	1
But they actually had a very thin but tight fitting suit on .	7
You know , so it shouldn't fall apart in his hands .	4
I suppose like the fathead you are , you told Father all your little hopes and dreams ?	3
Look what I found .	7
She died trying to save my daughter .	6
Be a good fellow and get out now .	1
I don't need fuckin' forensics to tell me this was some punk stealing luggage !	1
Which items ?	7
I'll never see you again .	6
You sound sort of peculiar .	7
Why am I here ?	7
That bitch has messed around with me .	1
Then there were some who just got tired of living .	6
[PERSON] , will we be lonely tonight ?	6
Don't you worry about [PERSON] . He can handle himself .	8
Ah . He tucked my parents into bed every night .	5
I hate getting upset .	1
Mr [PERSON] , [PERSON] , I'd like you to meet the greatest guy in the whole wide world .	2
Nothing doing .	1
This way , [PERSON] .	2
Rakonin has just given me the most amazing news .	5
How do you know I won't trick you and turn you in to the hands of the police ?	1
I'm always hiding from him , but he finds me .	4
Do you have a gun ?	4
I think I care too much .	6
Sorry about your finger .	6
It doomed me forever to middle management , and that's the truth .	6
As things are , there's no need for you to go through the Customs .	1
Thank goodness .	5
You idle apathetic !	3
I want to go home , now . I'll talk to [PERSON] .	2
And very heavily .	1
You've got to manage without the doctor .	4
Apparently my birth was not considered a blessed event .	7
I want the Governor's residence , [LOCATION] .	2
I got a ship to run .	2
Isn't this fun ?	5
That's very gracious of you .	5
Spirits soared , women swooned , and gods were created , gentlemen .	5
Because I always get lucky .	5
You look real nice in that ribbon .	5
[PERSON] continued to invade your privacy .	1
I should have taken my chances with the cannibals .	1
Looks like this case will be settled in no time .	2
I want one week to bring you proof and your promise that I will not be expelled and the bill won't be passed .	1
No . - [PERSON] , you're not finished .	1
Those were the last words she heard me say .	6
I got a run of three .	5
If we are to be defeated , then we prefer to be defeated ... as human beings , not as barbarians .	3
The [PERSON] whose testimony nearly sunk us all .	4
Mr. [PERSON] , I really appreciate all the work you do for him , but you and I know that my bloc is growing .	8
Slaughter ! You missed !	1
We're losing the wind !	1
For one thing , it'd get you off the streets .	1
If your men are as cocksure as you are , they might get through .	3
I was wondering if by any chance you guys were hiring .	7
Are you drunk ?	7
I'm drunker than you are , so it'll be a fair fight .	8
I'd have to lead them through .	8
I saw the same book in her room .	7
It means I haven't forgotten whose court I'm on .	1
Not good .	6
Your breath stinks of it .	3
What about dynamite ?	7
Forgive me for not recognizing you , Dr. [PERSON] .	1
Well , because that makes sense .	8
Sure , sure .	8
There's speculation that he's already ...	4
Fatter ? - No , Dad .	1
I want my money . I want to get out of here .	1
You are the most incredible creature I've ever met .	5
In your case , I wanted to test your loyalty to your companions .	8
Anyway , last year he comes to me . He wants some names checked out . Who was where , who's doing what .	1
Best you go ask him yourself .	2
You get a bonus and a raise .	5
I do declare , it looks like my head's gonna split open with all this singing and yelling and hallelujah - ing .	6
And I'll tell you all about that job .	8
The Belgian of the village ?	7
Go fuck a refrigerator , pecker neck !	1
Hold it .	1
Come on !	1
Open the goddamn door , [PERSON] !	1
Extra-terrestrial bodies , yes .	7
I think I'll take a nice dose of sleeping pills tonight .	2
Headless corpses .	6
Have fun !	5
And you and I are going out together .	2
Coming !	2
[PERSON] hates caffeine .	3
That's the stuff he fills the children's heads with !	3
Yeah , no , no !	1
I can't breathe in here .	6
Oh , no . That won't do .	4
He'll use everything in the book and then some he's made up to kill you .	3
When did you get a chance to do this , kid ?	7
[PERSON] , don't .	4
She's a wonderful girl .	5
I know that when there's something wrong , you tell me . But there's something going on that you won't let me understand .	4
Get rid of him , [PERSON] .	1
You ain't gonna have no crop because you got a sin on your soul .	3
We wound up on a train . - A train ?	7
Hey , come on !	2
glad to see you're out of jail .	6
I think I just became the first president to ever publicly mention Area .	2
He gave me some work to do and he left .	6
They're rather fond of me .	5
Isn't it marvellous ?	5
And congratulations . I heard you're going to replace Mr. [PERSON] .	8
Of all directions , why should I have chosen one leading to that parade ground of vulgarity which lies between Nice and [LOCATION] ?	1
[PERSON] , it's tapioca , Your favorite .	5
Then we'll have brunch by my private lake .	2
We can't let you out of here . You know that . Of course .	1
Brought about by what is know as  the miracle of love  .	5
Major [PERSON] will arrange for whatever facilities you may require .	8
Is not it so ?	7
You got ta go see him .	2
Your officers will work beside you .	8
Damn it , get in here !	1
Because you were right about [PERSON] .	8
Then stop calling me .	1
I'll design a costume all by myself and give you the surprise of your life .	2
I warned you !	1
No , don't do it .	1
You'd better hurry over there .	4
Come to think of it , everyone did look kind of undressed .	6
I'll get right back to you .	8
He said you were a saintly old man who didn't hold with all the vices .	8
Now what put that into your mind ?	7
I'm so glad to see you .	5
Only in [LOCATION] do people like us rise from oppression and poverty to join hands in this international event .	2
There isn't a cloud in sight .	4
The psycho - vigilante killer continues his daily diet for murder .	3
And you must trust me when I say it's likely we're all going to die .	4
There's more bad ?	4
The cobbler who fixed my shoes so beautifully yesterday .	5
Oh , yeah .	2
Of course , but we are only telling you because we know you'll want to rescue him .	8
Those two guys and [PERSON] , shit man , I seen them take on a gang of guineas with nothing but a knife and a broken bottle in their hand .	1
You think he's gonna say , I've had it  ? 	1
We ain't never been friends .	6
I don't want you to be angry with me for having predicted it . What ?	1
Oh , great news , I got some turkey burgers , you know we can grill , and watch a little Monday Night Raw tonight if you want ?	2
I'm pleased that we're having this closed executive session .	5
She did what ?	7
Loveliest room you've ever seen .	5
All right , [PERSON] boy , what we got ?	7
But why do you bring this up now ?	7
You know I am obliged to report you to the authorities .	8
Come on , you're kidding me , right ?	1
You don't have a boy !	1
You never wore that before .	7
You're not making any sense .	1
They gave me a piece of candy in the store .	5
Your skin stinks of it .	3
Tell her about our special student housing program .	2
But people just respected him , respected his , uh ...	6
Boys ...	1
And so will you .	8
I still insist he's paranoid .	4
Is that what you want ?	7
I hate him so fucking much .	1
I was so proud .	5
If you're dirty , you're going .	3
Did you come to see me for the same reason as the man with sweat on his face ?	3
Hey , it's all right , baby .	5
I'm not takin' a shower with him .	1
Let's do some good .	2
Hey , you're looking good .	5
Have they moved the embassy , or are you hijacking me ?	4
What that !	7
Imagine interplanetary trade , how exciting that would be ?	2
