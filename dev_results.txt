There's got ta be something else .	2
No , no , no . Shit .	1
I'm your brother [PERSON] .	8

Is murder a right reserved for that hated nation That has taken everything else from me ...	3
I'll be in the bar .	2

Maybe you should have thought of that before you sent her to rob my client .	1
Come on , it's Christmas .	2
I'll step you around this town like you've never been stepped before .	8
You should rest .	8
I'd like to know how she feels about who should be held responsible .	8

You know , for an Italian kid , you ain't got a bad butt .	3
They might have a hundred guns , but it's safer down here !	1

[PERSON] , listen to me .	1
You can rot for all I care .	3

All right , then .	1
All I can do is release you to make your own estimate of the situation .	1
Friends ?	2
You mean , you could sell us but you won't ?	1
If you need to take a break , you can .	8
You want me to talk with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics see if they have any problems ? Internal Revenue Service ?	4

There's no way to make this easy , [PERSON] .	1
Slow down , we lost [PERSON] !	4
I can't do this anymore .	6
And did you believe this nonsense ?	1

More mutilations !	1
We was safe there .	8
What should we name her ?	2
OK , so maybe I'll wise up someday too .	6

You're mistaken if you think I'm leaving her here ... with a mother who doesn't consider her reputation .	3
He's the only senator to have .	8
? For me and you ?	5
You think of me as sort of a cross between your wife and your mother .	3
How long are you staying in [LOCATION] , please , Mr [PERSON] ?	2
You know Mr. [PERSON] and Mr. [PERSON] from before ?	2
And you are the biggest liar of all !	1
Harry , what do you think would make [PERSON] happy ?	2

Did not it have to be resting ? Yes .	7
He's got all those .	7

If you are really brave and lucky , I can make you very , very rich .	8
I'm going to the zoo .	2
Any friends of mine are friends of his .	8

Storm the bastille !	1
Let me know if you see anything , huh ?	2
How could they with you here ?	7
The island's ours ?	7

Good luck .	8
Awesome . This is rad .	5
Look at that shit .	1
Boy , you amaze me .	5
There's no reason for anyone to come after me .	1
Okay , that didn't help at all .	1
[PERSON] , I can't make it so soon ...	4
When I first took a deal to become an undercover informant in a biker gang , I did it to save my own skin. ,	8
She's quite right . I'll look after them for you .	8
I'm going to join up with our brave lads in gray .	2
They may do a better job of it than we have .	8
One look from the head of [LOCATION] can turn all creatures into stone .	4
No , I'm serious .	1
Seems much slower than the other eight times I've seen it .	7
What is it , [PERSON] ?	2
You know , I'm thinking of training you for cashier . Really ?	1
You call this a tip , you cheap bastard ? !	1
Don't think for a minute That was an empty threat he made .	1
We're really gonna have a great time .	2
Will you go to the medical officer with me and repeat what you've said ?	1
[PERSON] , we have to go downstairs quickly !	4
After months of combat , it takes hours a day to keep her together .	6
This one is getting too popular .	6
I am sorry .	6
Fantastic , isn't it ?	5
You know I don't understand that shit .	1
Tell [PERSON] to wait in the shop for me .	2
I'll tear it out of the calendar .	1
I can't tell you that !	1
And when it comes time for her to marry ... well , she'll be a little princess .	2
And now , he wants to buy me ?	7
What's Zharkov doing on the plane ?	7
We'll make it to [LOCATION] if you're not careful !	1
Calm down !	1
I can't go to the grand jury without him .	6
Do not do this to me , [PERSON] .	1
God , what's our status ?	7
You're a one - man disaster area .	4
Why , [PERSON] , you aren't supposed to know anything about that .	7
Fine - looking couple , [PERSON] .	5
Oh , now , Mammy , be reasonable .	1
Have multiple targets sighted .	4
Judge , you said we would be entitled to some leeway ...	1
Come on , Dad .	1
I can't do this .	1
We haven't anything to discuss with you .	1
Yeah . - More than anything else in the world ?	7
It's only temporary , you know ?	1
Stop !	1
Sit down !	1
CinCPac wants it all to arrive on time and intact .	8
I mean , jeez ...	4
Leave me alone !	1
Thanks , Dad .	8
Send somebody for the militia .	8
You're not beginning that again , are you ?	1
Every living being is capable of attack ... if sufficiently provoked .	4
Yeah , he's right , we got to keep moving , [PERSON] .	8
It may bring you serious trouble .	4
Oh , this is so cool !	5
Let me talk to her again .	1
Why should I give a crap ?	1
Who bow and smile and scrape and spend their nights gnawing the chairs and floors out from under us all .	3
Okay ? - We're not dead yet ?	7
I don't say that with any kind of blame or accusation , but that is when it started .	1
Did you really think he would come with you ?	7
I've never felt more alive in my whole life .	5
What ? Get off my coat !	1
The question is what are you doing here ?	7
Perhaps that's why I'm incapable of having a child .	6
Cody , wait !	1
It is well .	5
If that horse would run tomorrow ,	2
There's my favourite little boy .	5
I'm trying to clean up the party . Our party . And I end up speaking out of turn .	1
So alone .	6
And don't try anything funny , cos you know what you'll get .	1
He says it's dangerous to spend the night in the village .	4
Everything's so clean . Everybody's so nice .	5
He was trying to stop it .	4
I think I've finally found a sport I like .	5
Somebody will listen to me .	1
My mommy hurt my head .  	6
Has decided to demolish ...	4
You look so cool !	5
My very best friends .	8
Give a girl a chance to breathe .	1
They're armed .	4
And it's a miracle old [PERSON]'s alive today .	7
Stole my Tintoretto . and my [PERSON] . And it has taken all [PERSON]'s bronze [LOCATION] the Countess .	2
I could have saved time and liquor by doing this in my office , but it needs a little ceremony .	1
It's dangerous jouncing Mrs. [PERSON] over open country .	4
My unit's due to be shipped out soon .	2
In which case , you'd be throwing out decades of disarmament progress .	1
Prisoner has a right to escape , hasn't he ?	1
Don't worry , kid !	8
You know ... Sometimes I even amaze myself .	5
I'd give my soul to go , but I can't .	6
You're not just a crook , but a murderer .	3
He's still emotionally unstable .	6
I'm sure you'll need them if you're gonna go into rats in detail .	8
You shut up , Dude , and listen to me .	1
Right there ... in those big blue eyes .	2
That's right .	5
Morphine syrette . Give me a morphine syrette . I got it .	1
I broke my glasses .	6
Welcome to [LOCATION] , ma'am .	2
You're nuts !	1
Myself . When I am in possession of my faculties and [PERSON] is not .	1
It made a thief of [PERSON] , a pig out of [PERSON] and a fool of you .	3
Well , it should be a pretty smooth flight . The weather's clear to [LOCATION] .	5
Your famous [PERSON] is safe .	8
You are dead inside .	4
Am I sure ?	2
I am the avenger .	8
No , no , no , I don't mean that .	1
It hurts me when people laugh at you .	3
But I had locked the briefcase of the [PERSON] in the morning following to her death .	6
I can't seem to keep you two out of the hospital lately .	6
I do not like Mr. [PERSON] .	1
I killed this person for their money , right ?	1
Thank you , Mr. [PERSON] .	8
Cheese doodles !	5
Maybe we'll get lucky .	2
They're here .	8
He never even heard of [PERSON] .	7
I rehearse my story . I try to think of all the questions they'll ask .	2
Hey , you know me .	5
Before proceeding further , I'll remind the visitors in the gallery that they are here as our guests and should conduct themselves as such .	8
What's the idea of turning her down ?	7
Well , now , there's a lovable chap .	5
Let me out , or I'll kill myself .	1
We're realists , knowing that we're on the outside looking in . - We calmly accept our uncertain position . - Yeah .	8
I killed her ! I killed her like she was an animal .	1
At my age , corrected by an illiterate .	3
There's some hot biscuits in the warmer .	5
[PERSON] , what the hell have you done to the coffee ?	1
The clerk will call the roll .	2
I'm getting darned sick of the way she's acting .	3
You do not deny , then , that such a monster could exist . Is that correct ?	1
If I was you , I would go home and talk to your family people .	8
Interesting problem we got on this one :	7
Their privilege , their presumption .	1
Think I'm a fool ?	1
m glad for you . 	5
[PERSON]'s looking for a new assistant and wants to meet you for a drink .	2
Oh , you little beauty !	5
[PERSON] , don't try it .	1
We got ta stick together , cos what are we ?	1
By the way ...	2
What'd he die of ?	4
She got what she deserves .	8
Yes ? What is it ?	2
She seemed too restless , too tense , too withdrawn , and [PERSON] , when he wasn't looking at [PERSON] , he was watching [LOCATION] look at Maria .	6
Just get out of my house .	1
He attacked your bitch .	1
Emergency speed , all engines !	4
Ready to celebrate ?	2
I know what you're going to say .	8
However , just at the moment , I have drinking to do .	3
It's not that easy to kill someone and get away with it .	1
I'm glad for the company .	5
It's yours , I want you to have it . It's for you .	8
It's Nobel Prize juice . Set sail for home , for [LOCATION] !	2
I've got some job possibilities for you .	2
I'll get some help !	8
Are you trying to kill me ?	4
It stung at first , but now I can't feel a thing .	6
I'll ... bet the size of the pot .	2
We're that kind of monster .	4
I'm going home . I - I'm not well .	6
It's funny , she didn't mention a husband .	7
Champagne !	5
Don't you get it ?	7
When does it leave ?	2
I did it , bro .	8
Aren't you human ?	7
She's alright . She's better than before .	8
That's how it looks in my report unless you've got something to change it .	1
What bothers you ?	1
Stop fidgeting .	1
Mayii : I had long since lost track Of the child [PERSON] .	6
Thank you for using ATT .	8
I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle .	6
